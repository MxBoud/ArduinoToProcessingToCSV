# ArduinoToProcessingToCSV

A little project for using Arduino and processing to do time domain data acquisition. In Arduino, signal from analog pin A0 is read through analogRead. Then the information is transmitted through serial port. The processing program help the user to configure the interval for data acquisition, the total sample number and the name of the csv file in which all the data is saved. 

Project is still in d√©veloppement. Some bugs are known.
